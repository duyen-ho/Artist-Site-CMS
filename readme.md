# Project 1: Content Management System for Mia Salsjo - Artist.

My friend Mia needs a new website.  
This project is a CMS-in-the-making and was coded in Ruby using the Sinatra framework.


### Approach

Project guidelines were followed and initial user stories and sketches were created. Online plans can be found here:
* [User Stories] (https://trello.com/b/3SZQlVrr/mia-salsjo-cms)
* [Database Schema] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Q-oDSO4BJ0TFpfdjg4bzgyNDg/view)
* [Wireframes] (https://app.mockflow.com/view/Db4e3fd168b8f0e368c1a5f375b436a8d#/page/2b0c3addf14a4cdfa1d6ff1f07897cfe)


### The Learning Process

Learning web development is a constantly evolving process. In making my first full stack web application, I learned a lot about my own expectations and current limitations. I have confidence issues and have been reluctant to admit that I am struggling and to ask for real one-to-one help.

Although I had set very achievable goals, I had to present an incomplete work which I saw as a failure and was encouraged to see otherwise. For me, it's a process of learning how-to-learn which is wonderful and humbling.

I was particularly overwhelmed by the size of the code in my `main.rb` file and investigated the process of refactoring Sinatra projects. I learned about separating route files - this [article](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/06/24/sinatra-best-practices-part-one/) was very helpful. I also applied [partials](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby/team-week-181ef311-0c31-4c75-b4cc-7495c7a98063/partials-in-sinatra) in this project.

I'm not used to _not getting things_ right away and turning theory into practice has been challenging. Learning how to debug problems is also an ongoing and crucial part of the process.


### Unsolved Problems / To Do List

* Learn how to use Carrierwave and Amazon S3 for image and video uploads.
* Better URI code design.
* Ability to reorder images.
* Ability to add new categories.
* Refine RTF functionality.
* More CSS.
* The future CMS dashboard displaying indexed works will have a grid layout focusing on administration functionality rather than aesthetics.
* The future Visitor Site will contain subtle jQuery animation and additions to layout.


### Future features

* Social media share links depending on the artist's requirements.
